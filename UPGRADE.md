# Upgrading SpiffyNavigation

## Upgrading from 0.2
- Configuration key renamed from `spiffynavigation` to `spiffy_navigation` to follow the conventions of all my modules.
- `properties` in pages renamed to `options` to properly denote usage. Using `properties` is deprecated and will trigger a
  warning but will still function.
